#Feedback Gathering Reconfiguration 

This module includes all components for feedback gathering reconfiguration.
We include:

- The input data (scenarios) to be tested. For instance: event condition actions for analysis, feature models for decision making, base models and variants for the itself "feedback gathering reconfiguration".

- Adapter: component that adapts the suggested configuration to a "actual" configuration, i.e. we interpret the suggested configuration to configurations actions applied on Feature Gathering tool.

- Enacter: component that calls the reconfiguration services, i.e. calls the Orchestrator services to reconfigure the feedback gathering tool.
